# Volume control system using gestures
In this project we are going to learn how to use Gesture Control to change the volume of a computer. 
We first look into hand tracking and then we will use the hand landmarks to find gesture of our hand to change the volume.

## Features
* Can change your computer's volume based on your hand activity
* Can track your hand in real-time


## Special help
You might face issue with webcam not showing or something related to webcam.
To solve it just change the value/webcam from python files.

`cv2.VideoCapture(0)`

You can increment the number `0` until you see your webcam.
